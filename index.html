        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! I’m Adrian Marcatoma, a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota with a strong interest in
            backend development, cybersecurity, and machine learning. I enjoy tackling challenges through code and finding
            efficient solutions that actually make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of tech, I’m passionate about music — not just listening, but understanding how it’s made, produced, and
            shared. I love projects that blend creativity with logic, like organizing music by emotion or building
            mood-based playlist tools. I'm also exploring machine learning as a way to bridge data and expression, with
            hopes of applying it to real-world problems in both tech and art.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether I'm coding, creating, or connecting with others, I'm all about growth. I’m always learning, always
            evolving, and always looking to build something that matters.
